### 📝 Notes for Team Leaders

- Each team member should focus on **one main component** at a time
- **Communication is key** - discuss changes that affect multiple components
- **Test thoroughly** before submitting changes
- **Follow the existing code style** for consistency
- **Document any new features** or significant changes

### 🔧 Common Tasks
